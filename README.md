# visuals runner

hii :3 this project ~~is~~ *will be* a system for running visuals for my music shows. the visuals will be reactive and synchronized with the music (of course) and integrate macos' window manager as an element of its aesthetic unless i run out of time this semester

if you wanna hear my music, [take a listen](https://odd.horse)!

## overview

this project receives osc data from ableton live and uses it to control and display reactive visuals. the visuals are displayed by dynamically controlling small desktop windows displaying 3d objects or gifs in time with the music.

## tech stack

at this point i'm just using [processing](https://processing.org/), which is kinda gross but essentially i don't have the time to implement the inevitably more complex foundations for any nicer tool.

hopefully someday i can figure out how to do multi-window bullshit with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) because it does seem really nice.

for now processing seems fine. hopefully it isn't too limiting for what i wanna do in this short term i'm shooting for

## let it be knownnn

GUYS I FUCKING HATE WRITING READMES AND TEHCNICAL BULLSHIT LIKEthis its so unfun. but i'm in rome or whatever right so here's your techslop hope it's nice

## features (no none of them are implemented yet. app wit no features blehhhhh!!!!!)

- **osc data integration**: will receive osc data from ableton live.
- **reactive visuals**: will display visuals that react in real-time to the music.
- **multiple windows**: will display 3d objects or gifs by dynamically creating windows on the desktop.

## roadmap

### phase 1: initial setup

- [x] set up the project structure.
- [ ] basic window management for displaying visuals.
- [ ] integrate osc data reception from ableton live.

### phase 2: visuals development

- [ ] develop 3d object rendering.
- [ ] implement gif display functionality.
- [ ] synchronize visuals with osc data.

### phase 3: optimization and testing

- [ ] optimize performance for multiple windows.
- [ ] conduct extensive testing with live music.
- [ ] gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### phase 4: finalization

- [ ] finalize the user interface.
- [ ] prepare documentation and user guides.
- [ ] release the first stable version.

## contributing

no way i've given enough info for anyone to reasonably contribute here and no way this stuff is directly useful enough (like more than a code example) to anyone else for anyone to actually care to contribute either

but yeah if you wanna i would be ridiculously grateful so pr it or whateva

## license

i have not decided on the license for this. let it be known that i'm not a greedy hungry pig anymore but yeah ima want recognition
