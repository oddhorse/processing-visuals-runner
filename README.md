# visuals runner

hii :3 this project ~~is~~ will be a system for running visuals for my music shows. the visuals will be reactive and synchronized with the music (of course) and integrate macos' window manager as an element of its aesthetic.

if you wanna hear my music, [take a listen](https://odd.horse)!

## overview

this project receives osc data from ableton live and uses it to control and display reactive visuals. the visuals are displayed by dynamically controlling small desktop windows displaying 3d objects or gifs in time with the music.

## tech stack

at this point i'm just using [processing](https://processing.org/), which is kinda gross but essentially i don't have the time to implement the inevitably more complex foundations for any nicer tool.

hopefully someday i can figure out how to do multi-window bullshit with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) because it does seem really nice.

for now processing seems fine. hopefully it isn't too limiting for what i wanna do in this short term i'm shooting for

## features (to be implemented...)

- **osc data integration**: will receive osc data from ableton live.
- **reactive visuals**: will display visuals that react in real-time to the music.
- **multiple windows**: will manage multiple small windows displaying 3d objects or gifs.
